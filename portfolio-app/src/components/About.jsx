            Based in Auckland, New Zealand, I'm a penultimate-year software
            engineering student passionate about pursuing a career as a
            full-stack developer. As an enthusiastic individual, I thrive on
            problem-solving and constructing solutions that benefit others. With
            a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a drive
            for continuous learning, I am dedicated to honing my skills and
            utilising the latest technologies. Some well versed technical skills
            I possess are Java, React, and Javascript as shown in my projects.
